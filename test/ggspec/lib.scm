#!
Stub out any variable in any module (including the current module) with
a new value (which could be a function), evaluate some expressions,
restore the old variable value, and return the result value from the
last of the evaluated expressions.

Arguments
  mod-name: '(name-component ...): the module name. Optional. If
  omitted, assumed to be the current module. E.g. '(ggspec lib).

    name-component: one of the components of the module name.

  var-name: symbol: the name of the variable to stub out. E.g. 'map.

  val: any (including function): the new value to give to the
  stubbed-out variable.

  expr ...: any number of expressions to evaluate in the context of the
  new value.

Returns
  The return value from the last of the evaluated 'expr's.

#!
Checks that the first argument is near the second, optionally specifying
how near with the third argument. This is useful for comparing
floating-point numbers. E.g., if you do:

  (assert-equal 3.3 (* 3 1.1))

... the assertion will fail because of floating-point arithmetic. But if
you do:

  (assert-near 3.3 (* 3 1.1))

  within: number: the maximum distance we want to tolerate between 'got'
  and 'expected'. Optional. If omitted, assumed to be 0.01.

  'got' is near 'expected', with the default or custom-set tolerance, or

#!
Declares a setup symbol-binding.

Arguments
  'sym: symbol: a symbol by which to refer to the bound value.

  expr ...: any: a variable number of expressions, the last of which will be
  bound to the symbol above. This value may later be accessed from any test in
  the same suite by calling the test's 'environment' (usually e) with the
  symbol. E.g., (e 'sym).
!#

(define tests list)

#!
Declares a test.

Arguments
  desc: string: a description of the test.

  env: an 'environment' (an alist of names and bindings) that is passed
  in to the test. Two types of names are defined:

    1. Names always automatically defined by ggspec before running the
    test: 'assert-equal, 'assert-not-equal, etc. These are defined by
    ggspec automatically because they depend on the suite options like
    where to send test runtime messages to.

    2. Names defined by the test writer by setting up names and
    corresponding values in the suite setup section. The corresponding
    values are evaluated anew each time a test is run, which is why in
    the setup section you have to wrap each value up inside a thunk.

  expr: a value returned by one of the above assertion functions. An
  expression that makes up the body of the test. This will be wrapped
  inside a function and the function will be passed in the 'environment'
  env from above.

  opts: same type as in 'suite', above. Optional (default is no
  options).

Returns
  (list desc opts func): a three-member list of the test description,
  the options passed in to the test, and the unevaluated function making
  up the body of the test.

(define teardowns list)

#!
Declares a teardown. Every teardown will be run after each test, and
each teardown will be passed the 'environment' that was defined for that
test.

Arguments
  env: same as in 'test', above.

  expr ...: any number of expressions.

Returns
  A function which takes an 'environment' and carries out any number of
  actions.
